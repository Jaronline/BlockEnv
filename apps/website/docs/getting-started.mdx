# Getting Started

## Requirements

To use BlockEnv, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system.

## Installation

To get started with BlockEnv, you can install it in your project using a package manager like npm or yarn using the following command:

<PMTabs npm="npm install --save-dev --save-exact @jaronline/blockenv" yarn="yarn add --dev --exact @jaronline/blockenv"
    pnpm="pnpm add --save-dev --save-exact @jaronline/blockenv" />

## Configuration

After installing BlockEnv, you need to create a configuration file in your project root directory.
This configuration file should be named `blockenv.config.json` and should contain at least the following structure:

```json
{
  "baseDir": "environment"
}
```

Replace `"environment"` with the path to the directory where you want to store your BlockEnv environments.

## Running environments

There are two types of environments you can run with BlockEnv: clients and servers.
Client environments are used for testing a modpack in the Minecraft client, while server environments are used for testing a modded Minecraft server.

### Running a client environment

To run the basic client environment, you will first need to set it up using the following command:

<CommandTabs command="blockenv setup --side client --loader MOD_LOADER --loader-version MOD_LOADER_VERSION" />

This will download the necessary files and set up the environment for you.
This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

After the setup is complete, you can run the client environment using:

<CommandTabs command="blockenv launch --side client --profile PROFILE_NAME" />

See `launcher_profiles.json` in your environment directory (`client`) for available profiles.

### Running a server environment

To run the basic server environment, you will first need to set it up using the following command:

<CommandTabs command="blockenv setup --side server --loader MOD_LOADER --loader-version MOD_LOADER_VERSION" />

This will download the necessary files and set up the environment for you.
This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

After the setup is complete, you can run the server environment using:

<CommandTabs command="blockenv launch --side server" />

## Global installation

The BlockEnv CLI can be installed globally using `npm install --global @jaronline/blockenv`.
This allows you to run the `blockenv` command from anywhere in your terminal.
However, you will still need to configure your project with a configuration file.
